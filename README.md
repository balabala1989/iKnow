### What it does?
	
	A fun app that you can prank your friends
	
	This is how it works
	
	1. App has two text box. One for request salutaion and another for question.
	2. When you start typing the request salutaion start with dot.
	3. Whatever you type after dot will be treated as answer. End the answer with dot.
	4. When you type the answer, the app hides it but rather type the salutaion by itself masking the answer
	5. Now type the answer and press sybmit
	6. What ever the answer typed by you will be present which will surprise your friend on how app was able to tell the answer
	7. When they type, they do not know that dot is required. So when they ask question, App just generalize the answer
